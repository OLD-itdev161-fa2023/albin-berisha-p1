# Project Description

My final project for this class will be creating a simple search engine website for the resorts here in Wisconsin. 
For project one, I'm implementing the following:

- Four endpoints in the API,
- NodeJS Express Server backend,
- Postman to test the API endpoints
- Created the cluster on MongoDB
- Implementation of the result on MongoDB Compass.

Below are the images of Postman endpoints, the MongoDB cluster, and the final Mongo Compass database.
